Hi Amber or Abraham, if you are reading this then I am sorry but I have not finished touching up my readme and only have the basic functionality of the manager view submitted for hw. I plan on making this readme better (adding a gif and adding in the tests section) as well as incorporating the supervisor view and some table formatter after my headaches go away (hopefully this weekend). What I have submitted was just the barebones that could be graded so I could still receive something for this assignment but I want to improve it in the future.

## Getting Started

Just make sure you npm install the prerequsite mysql and inquirer so the program can function.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a package.json file with dependencies for mysql and inquirer and then navigate to the file in terminal and:

```
npm install
```

### Installing

Should you not have the dependencies or a package.json file. Navigate to the file in terminal and if you do not have the package.json file:

```
npm init -y
```

To create the package.json file. After you have the package.json:

```
npm install mysql inquirer
```

To install the required node modules for this program to run.
